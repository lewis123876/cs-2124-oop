Heyyyyy

This is all my OOP work for fall 2024. By God's grace, I got an A- in the class. 
In the recitation section, you will see all of my Labs in which I earned all 100s.
PLEASE DO NOT leave the lab without checking out. Essential for doing well in the class.

All the files in Homeworks have the files I submitted; their respective blurb.txt file
is my grade. Please view the blurb while using my homework for reference to ensure you don't repeat
my mistakes. Also, DO NOT copy. You will be jeopardizing you and me; I am trying to do the youngins
a favor and share my stuff; don't ruin it for everyone.

Anyway, good luck!
